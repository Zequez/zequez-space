        Agora.Mardel is a collaborative app for my hometown to help all
        our local vegan, biodynamic, cooperative and environmental
        organizations, businesses and activists.
      -
        The strategy is to build it in a way that can be self-managed by
        locals and progressively add in decentralized technology over time
        (I want it to use Holochain and IPFS). I'm going to keep adding
        tools as I find the systems and people that would benefit from
        them.
      -
        I also want it to serve as a place to redirect people when doing
        activism locally.

      - In my aspiration to learn Rust so I can code for Holochain, and in my
        mesmerization with fractals and the Universe, I created this and put
        my newly acquired knowledge of Rust to the test and dipped my toes
        in WebAssembly.

      - While the water was cold and confusing, and I still don't really understand
        how macros work, I was told I don't need to learn to CREATE macros to understand
        how to use them, which is true for most of the technology we use nowadays. The
        experience was overall pleasant.

        Coming from mostly a place of high-level languages, Rust was a bit scary to be honest.
        Last time I used a high level language was years ago, first on my early days of programming
        with C++ and Pascal (in school), and later when I was playing with Arduino. Took me
        a while to get myself to actually sit and start learning. Seems like a small thing
        but to my it's a big _heal_. The incessant noise in my head that was telling me
        I was too old, or I that I should already know all this stuff, how could I call me
        myself a programmer! *Shame on me? Right!?*, that voice, that voice is a little quieter.

      -
        Sure I know I'm not the voices in my head, sure, I can see it now. But
        how often is the voice just quiet enough so you can't hear it, but loud
        enough that you are feeling it? And how often is quiet enough you can't
        even feel it anymore, but it's eternally being dimly imprinted in everything you see?
        In every thought you experience?

        Let's talk about fractals. We're all fractals, and we all love fractals, isn't that
        beautiful? Look at a brocoli, look at a tree, look at your hand, look at your
        family, look at your mind, look at the forest, look at the river, look at water,
        look at yourself. Everywhere you look we see fractals. Who knows what's going on?
        Who is to say that the whole universe isn't contained in a single atom? Who is to say
        the whole universe isn't contained in my being? Who are we?

        I learned a bit about how memory works
        Fractals are fascinating
