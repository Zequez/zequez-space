      I learned English by necessity, I hated being taught English when I was a kid,
      but then when I started browsing the Internet I wanted to understand and I just
      absorbed it by osmosis, I couldn't really said I ever sat to learn English.

    description:
      Ruby is a fun language, the nifty one-liners and the way you can iterate
      through arrays it's just fun to do. I learned it mostly for Rails and then
      I wrote quite a few tools to scrap websites and to do tasks on my computer.
      Nowadays I value more type safety and explicitness when choosing
      a language. But the magic of Ruby is still in my heart.

    description:
      Coming from scripting languages, when you first start writing type safe
      software it feels a little cumbersome, but then when you taste the joy of
      errors being detected at built-time and easy refactoring, you are sold.
      I mostly write anything JS related on TypeScript today.

    description:
      This is the bread and vegan butter of the web nowadays. JavaScript dominates
      every corner of the Earth, it's like air. I enjoy using it not because the
      language itself is really that fun, but the things you can do with it
      are just endless. If you don't like the language, you can just find another one
      that compiles to JavaScript, which is awesome. Nowadays I like TypesScript and Elm
      on that regard.

    name: Elm

    description:
      Elm is a pure functional programming language for the front end. It was
      the original inspiration for Redux. I gotta say, coding in Elm feels FUN,
      the compiler is so nice that it feels like you're just playing golf to get
      everything done the most gracefully, the code just feels perfect and bug-free
      when you look at it. It's a great feeling.
      I really don't have much production experience, but I did write a small app
      to track activities (The Hero Journey) in Elm, which I might continue in the future,
      it's unfinished.

    description:
      I mostly desire to learn Rust to code for Holochain. Rust is like C++ but
      better, and made by Mozilla, which is great, it's a great foundation.
      I haven't started yet, aside from the basic "hello world", but I'll get there,
      and I'm very interested on getting there, I never managed to get very
      proficient with a systems-programming language (I used C/C++ for some time
      and to write some Arduino scripts, but that's all), so I would really love to
      learn.

    description:
      Come one, this was my bread an vegan butter back in the day when I was
      learning how to use the web. I probably wrote the most buggy, insecure
      software I ever did. But did it work? Well yes, most of the time.
      Joking aside, I really did mostly learned programming with PHP and
      I built a great deal of sites before I learned Ruby & Rails.
      I remember when I first heard about FRAMEWORKS, my mind was blown, they solved
      so many problems that I was solving by writing my own set of tools. I was
      pleasantly surprised to discover that they actually used some of the same patterns
      I figured out on my own.
      All in all, PHP served me well.

    description:
      I used CoffeeScript back when I was learning Rails. It was fun, it was
      pretty, and it served me well. I built a web app (Mapa de Transportes) that
      the front end was all CoffeeScript and no frameworks, was fun.
      Nowadays, I value type-safety and JavaScript has evolved to have such an
      incredible amount of features, that I find no reason to write on CoffeeScript
      rather than TypeScript.
frameworks:

    description:
      React is the hammer of the web. Honestly, it's the go-to solution to build
      anything as quick as possible with the maximum community support.
      It also has the highest demand if you're seeking to find conventional work.
      It's a great tool and I like using it.
  -
    name: Svelte
    experience: 7
    interest: 6
    description:
      Svelte is a framework that gets precompiled on build and allows you
      to do reactive programming on a budget. Imagine the reactivity of MobX
      but lightweight like lit-html. It's very light, and it's very interesting.
      It also has great support for animations.

    description:
      At first I was hesitant about all the extra weight of the app and all the
      extra KB of data. Then I started actually using it and stopped worrying.
      Gatsby it's actually a great peace of tech, the plugins solve a lot of
      things you would have to manually configure on Webpack. I mean, it does uses
      Webpack on the back.
      Honestly, if you want to forget about your build system, Gatsby is a cool
      option, it does a lot of optimizations and configuring for you. It would be
      cool if they supported other frameworks in addition to React though.
      NextJS on static-only mode seems like a good alternative also.

    description:
      Rails served me well. It was a huge update from frameworkless PHP and
      it landed me some incredible jobs that allowed me to move forward in
      my life, so I'm in deep gratitude.
      That said, while I still believe it's an incredible tech and allows you to
      create quick web apps, I really don't enjoy using it much anymore and
      it doesn't stir much interest in me.
      I believe the future is with decentralized applications, so monolithic backends
      like Rails are not really useful for that. The party is the the front.
  -
    name: NextJS
    experience: 3

    description:
      I'll be honest, I don't have much experience with NextJS. It's a React
      framework that does server side rendering and also works on the backend.
      I usually don't do a lot of backend work nowadays, I enjoy mostly the front
      end, so never had much use for this. Most of the backend work I did was on
      Rails, and now I'm more interested on decentralized applications, which are
      front-end heavy.

      You know when there is something that the first time you see it you say
      "what the heck, that's horrible I would never use that". And then you start
      using and it starts to grow on you. Tailwind was like this for me. At first
      it was the ugliest thing, it was against everything I was taught about
      writing styles on the web. And then, when you feel the release of not having
      to come up with class names for everything you do, and just working
      with the HTML and doing classes on JS, you understand.

      NodeJS is just JavaScript for general programming outside web browsers.
      It's a nice tech and there are countless tools and software built with it.
      I enjoy using as much as I enjoy using JavaScript and TypeScript.

      HTML is just a set of default components that web browsers all agree to
      render in the same way. It's the building blocks of the web, so there is that.

    description:
      CSS is what we do to style things on the web. We change the colors, the
      layout, the design, etc. It's an extensive field of knobs you can touch
      to tune the web to your liking. I love touching the knobs and making wacky
      stuff.
      I also have experience using precompilers like SASS, LESS, Stylus, and
      PostCSS with it's plugins.

      The web is a collection of technologies that work together to bring you
      This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web browsers, build systems
      (such as Webpack, Parcel, Rollup), and a myriad of libraries and related
      tech. The web has been my playground since I was a kid, it's my water.

      Google or Amazon cloud computing servers.

      The Inter-Planetary File System is a way to store files on a global
      Distributed Hash Table (DHT), it's an amazing new tech that allows humanity
      to share files on the Internet without boundaries. Truly the future of hosting,
      combine it with Holochain, and you have a new Internet.

    description:
      I believe this is the future of software platforms. It an amazing new technology
      that allows for decentralized, scalable, protocol-based applications that no one owns.
      If you never heard of it, you're on for a ride, google it out, it's incredible, I'm
      super hyped.
      The development of the zomes (the apps) is made on Rust and then compiled to WASM, so I'm
      on my journey to learn Rust now.
      It's not a blockchain, and every app lives on it's own network. The apps may
      then be combined to make a mosaic. Truly the future.

      Blockchain, the tech that I always wanted to learn but never did. I mean,
      I know the gist of it, I understand how they work, but I haven't actually written
      much software for it. Honestly, now that Holochain is in the horizon, blockchain seems
      a little less enticing.

      This is the new thing in databases, TBH I like it more than relational databases,
      it's less data conversions from the app to the storage system. I first learned
      touched the subject on Firebase and now I'm knees deep into CouchDB for a current
      project because I wanted something less propietary.

      The first DB I used was MySQL on the time of PHP. Then when I started coding
      in Ruby & Rails everyone was using Postgress, so I used that too. It's really
      not much of a difference, most of the stuff is abstracted by ORM layers anyway.
      I can read raw SQL and write basic queries though; and complex queries if you give
      me some time and access to Google.
