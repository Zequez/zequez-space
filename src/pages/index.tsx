          Imagine if you could create a fantastic technological device that
          helped beings around the world. Now imagine this device, once
          designed, could be magically reproduced over and over without any
          cost! That's how software works, it's an infinite gift that keeps on
          giving! I don't see any reason to create artificial scarcity of
          anything I create, everything I do is a gift I can give to everyone.

          Aside from the open source work I do, I can also help you directly
          with anything. Maybe some web/app, consulting, maintenance, or maybe
          just an idea you would like to explore and think I could be of help.
          I'll be happy to work together with you! Just ask!

          There is a whole spectrum of material wealth that I can use to support
          my life and my loved ones in wholesome ways. It's not about surviving,
          it's about thriving, it's about having access to the things that
          support me in expressing my highest version of myself and my mission
          in life. I want to create a more beautiful world for me and everyone
          around me.

          Whatever form of kindness you want to manifest, just get in touch with
          me so we can explore it together!
